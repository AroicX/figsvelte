# figma-plugin-svelte-boilerplate
A boilerplate for creating Figma plugins with Svelte.

This starter project has everything you need to start developing a Figma plugin usign Svelte. Your JS, CSS, SVG and image assets can be bundled on build. Additionally, this package comes preconfigured with [Figma Plugin DS Svelte](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds-svelte) where you have access to a large range of components and icons that match the Figma UI, to get you up and running quickly. Note: installing this package will install the component library as a dependency.

npx degit thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-svelte-boilerplate figma-plugin
cd figma-plugin
npm install

```
